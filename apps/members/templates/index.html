<h2>Welcome to <em>Dozo</em></h2>

  <p>Welcome to <em>Dozo</em>, a data-driven productivity, collaboration, and goal targeting tool.</p>

<h2>Why Join?</h2>

  <p>We all have different methods and means of progress in our journeys to becoming self-sufficient developers, but there are two main determining factors for our success: <em>time</em> and <em>efficiency</em>.</p>

  <p>With Dozo, you can optimize your growth as a developer by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visualize your hours</strong> spent at the Dojo or wherever you're able to find time to code.</li>
    <li><strong>Set personal goals</strong> for each day and work towards accomplishing them before the day ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Track your progress</strong> and update others on where you are in the learning platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay connected</strong> with your cohort-mates and others at the Dojo so that everyone can grow together.</li>
  </ul>
