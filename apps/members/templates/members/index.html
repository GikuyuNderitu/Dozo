<h2>Welcome to <em>Dozo</em></h2>

  <p>Welcome to <em>Dozo</em>, a IoT-powered, data-driven productivity, collaboration, and goal targeting tool.</p>

  <p>We all have different methods and means of progress in our journeys to becoming self-sufficient developers,
    <br>but there are two main determining factors for our success: <em>time</em> and <em>efficiency</em>.</p>

  <p>With <em>Dozo</em>, here's how you can optimize your growth as a developer:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visualize your hours</strong> spent at the Dojo or wherever you're able to find time to code</li>
    <li><strong>Set personal goals</strong> for each day and work towards accomplishing them before the day ends</li>
    <li><strong>Track your progress</strong> and update others on where you are in your learning track</li>
    <li><strong>Check in and stay connected</strong> with cohort-mates through virtual stand-up meetings</li>
  </ul>

<h2>How <em>Dozo</em> Works</h2>

<p>In general, <em>Dozo</em> is about keeping it simple:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sign up for IFTTT and connect it to your device and this website</li>
    <li>When you arrive at the Dojo, Dozo will log your start of day</li>
    <li>Take a minute to jot down your day's goals -- they'll show up on the newsfeed</li>
    <li>Check off each goal and that'll be up on the wall too</li>
    <li>Check your personal dashboard to see your time, progress, and efficiency score</li>
    <li>Visit the assignments pages to read what others are posting about each assignment</li>
</ul>
